Based on the following 24/7 Runbook, create a Mermaid diagram that shows the decision-making process for a support engineer responding to an incident.

The diagram should:
1. Show what observations/symptoms to look for
2. Guide the engineer through the decision-making process based on those observations
3. Show what remediation actions to take
4. Use the most appropriate Mermaid diagram type for this decision-making process (e.g., flowchart, state diagram, etc.)
5. Use left-right (LR) orientation for flowcharts rather than top-down (TD) for better horizontal readability
6. Include explanatory text directly in node labels where they will help clarify the decision or action
7. Add clickable links to relevant dashboards, documentation, or tools where they will help the engineer

Focus on the key decision points and actions that a support engineer would need to make during an incident.

IMPORTANT SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS:
- Ensure the Mermaid diagram syntax is completely valid and will render without errors
- Use left-right orientation: flowchart LR (not flowchart TD)
- Do NOT use parentheses () in node labels - use square brackets, quotes, or other descriptors instead
- Avoid special characters that might break Mermaid parsing (parentheses, semicolons, etc.)
- Use proper Mermaid flowchart syntax with valid node definitions
- Test that all node IDs are unique and properly referenced
- Use HTML entities or escape sequences if special characters are absolutely necessary
- Do NOT use note syntax (e.g., "note right of NodeID") - it is not supported in Mermaid flowcharts
- Instead, add explanatory text directly in node labels using <br/> for line breaks: NodeID[Main text<br/>Explanatory note]
- Add clickable links using the click syntax: click NodeID "URL" "Tooltip text"
- Use links for dashboards, runbooks, documentation, AWS console links, monitoring tools, etc.

Please generate only the Mermaid diagram code without additional explanation. Ensure the syntax is 100% valid and will render in a markdown file without parse errors.
